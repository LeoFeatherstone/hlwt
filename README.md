# How Long Will It Take
## To pay off a debt accruing compound interest

### This tool **approximates** the time needed to pay off a debt accruing compound interest

### NB: I am not in any way a qualified financial analyst. While I use this tool personally, and have conferred with other calculators such as that from [Domain](https://www.domain.com.au/home-loans/calculators/home-loan-repayment-calculator/), this will not give an exact answer and will differ from reality. Some of the reasons for this include fluctuating interest rates and that this calculator assumes all months are of equal length, so some discrepancy between real and predicted interest accrued will arise.
