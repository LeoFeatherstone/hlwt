# How Long Will It Take
## To pay off a debt accruing compound interest

## About
### This tool **approximates** the time needed to pay off a debt accruing compound interest

## Disclaimer
### NB: I am not in any way a qualified financial analyst. While I use this tool personally, and have conferred with other calculators such as that from [Domain](https://www.domain.com.au/home-loans/calculators/home-loan-repayment-calculator/), this will not give an exact answer and will differ from reality. Some of the reasons for this include fluctuating interest rates and that this calculator assumes all months are of equal length, so some discrepancy between real and predicted interest accrued will arise.

## Why build this?
I used to teach basic financial mathematics to secondary students. It struck me that they were always 
taught how much money they could have if they invested today, but never how much the bank could have if 
it invested in the student (a loan in other words). I'm also motivated by a lack of calculators that show 
how long it might take to pay off student debt in Australia.
